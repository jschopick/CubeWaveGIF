# The Cube Wave GIF

## `Inspiration`

Twitter user @beesandbombs created an amazing GIF of an oscillating cube: https://twitter.com/beesandbombs/status/940639806522085376

YouTuber, The Coding Train, created a video in his coding challenge series attempting to recreate this GIF: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H81Tdrmz2LA

This project was inspired by The Coding Train's video. I followed along with his tutorial and continued expanding the project to try to get as close to the original GIF as possible.

## `Technologies Used`

p5.js: A JavaScript client-side library for creating graphic and interactive experiences, based on the core principles of Processing. See here for details: https://p5js.org/

React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Specifically, I used create-react-app to bootstrap the application. See here for details: https://reactjs.org/
